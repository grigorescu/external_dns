__preload__.zeek
================

This is loaded automatically at Zeek startup once the plugin gets activated,
but before any of the BiFs that the plugin defines become available.

This is primarily for defining types that BiFs already depend on.  If you
need to do any other unconditional initialization, that should go into
__load__.zeek instead.
