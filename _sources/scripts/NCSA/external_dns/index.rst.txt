External DNS Detection
======================

This script will detect usage of external DNS servers.

:doc:`/scripts/NCSA/external_dns/__load__.zeek`

   This is processed when a user explicitly loads the plugin's script module
   through `@load NCSA/external_dns`.
   Include code here that should execute at that point.

:doc:`/scripts/NCSA/external_dns/main.zeek`

   Raises a notice when a client is observed querying an external DNS server
